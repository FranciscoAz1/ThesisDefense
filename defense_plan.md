# Defense Timing Plan (20 min + 5 min Q&A)

| Segment | Minutes | Slide Ref | Notes |
|---------|---------|-----------|-------|
| Title / Hook | 1 | Title | One-line problem impact |
| Motivation + Problem | 2 | Mot./Problem (2 slides) | Emphasize pain & risk |
| Research Gap | 1 | Gap | Transition to objectives |
| Objectives (2 slides) | 2 | Objectives Overview/Details | Keep concise verbs |
| Architecture Overview | 2 | Arch Overview + Schema | Show pipeline + UML |
| Graph + Agent Traversal | 2 | Construction + Traversal | Highlight dependency handling |
| MCP Server + Control Perspective | 2 | MCP + Control | Standardization + robotics framing |
| Related Work (2 slides) | 2 | RW slides | Contrast prior limits |
| Evaluation Questions | 1 | Eval Qs | Frame metrics as answers |
| Results (Single + Multi + Insights) | 4 | Results 3 slides | Call deltas; avoid overcrowding |
| Contributions | 1 | Contributions | Enumerated highlights |
| Conclusions (animated) | 1 | Conclusions | Reveal each point |
| Limitations + Future Work | 1 | Limitations + Future | End with publication target |
| Buffer / Transition | 1 | (Flexible) | Absorb overruns |
| Q&A | 5 | Backup slides | Tailor answers; use backups |

Total planned talk time: 20 minutes + 5 minutes Q&A.

## Pacing Tips
- Aim ~25–30 seconds per bullet on dense slides.
- Use verbal signposts: "Architecture has three layers..." "Now, how does this compare?".
- If time slips: compress Related Work to one key contrast; skip Control slide detail.

## Key Slide Priorities
1. Motivation risk example.
2. Traversal flow diagram.
3. Single-collection results table (highlight delta).
4. Contributions enumeration.

## Visual Rhythm
- High info density: Architecture, Results tables.
- Lower density recovery: Objectives, Contributions.

## Pre-Q&A Reminder
- Invite questions referencing dependencies, temporal reasoning, scalability.
